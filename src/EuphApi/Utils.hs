{-
 - Nick manipulation
 -}

-- | Convert a nick to an @-mentionable version.
-- Use this function when you want to @-mention somebody.
--
-- This removes spaces and some extra characters, while trying to stay close to
-- the original nick.
mention :: T.Text -> T.Text

-- | Same as 'atMention', but prepends an `@` character.
atMention :: T.Text -> T.Text
atMention = T.cons '@' . mention

-- | Reduces a nick to a normal form such that all nicks that get @-mentioned
-- by the same @-mention are reduced to the same normal form.
--
-- Use this function when you want to compare two nicks.
mentionReduce :: T.Text -> T.Text

{-
 - Commands
 -}

-- | A simple function that is to be called with the content of received messages.
--
-- If you just want to add a simple command, see 'command' and 'specificCommand'.
-- For more flexibility/more regex-like functionality, see 'commandFromParser'.
