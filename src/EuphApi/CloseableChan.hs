-- | Chans that can be closed and reopened.
--
-- While a 'CloseableChan' is closed (or locked), it can not be written to or read from.
-- Calls to 'writeChan' and 'readChan' are non-blocking while a chan is closed.
--
-- If a thread is attempting to read from a chan using 'readChan' and that chan is closed,
-- the call to 'readChan' resumes and @Nothing@ is returned.
