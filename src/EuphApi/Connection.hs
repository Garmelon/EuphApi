-- | Setup consisting of a few threads to send and receive packets to and from
-- the euphoria api using a websocket connection.
--
-- Objects of type 'Connection' represent a connection to a server.
-- @Connection@s can't be reused, so to reconnect to a server, a new @Connection@ object
-- must be used.
--
-- To connect to a server, a new connection must be created using the
-- 'startEuphConnection' command.
--
-- == Example
--
-- > import qualified EuphApi.Connection as E
-- >
-- > main = do
-- >   putStrLn "> Connecting to euphoria.io, &test"
-- >   con <- E.startEuphConnection "euphoria.io" "test"
-- >   printEvents con
-- >   where
-- >     printEvents con = do
-- >       event <- E.getEvent con
-- >       case event of
-- >         ConnectionFailed -> putStrLn "> Could not connect. Are you sure that room exists?"
-- >         Disconnected     -> putStrLn "> Connection closed. Bye!"
-- >         EuphEvent e      -> print e
